== Getting Started

=== Installation

1. Install pipn from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pipn-auto-picture-in-picture/[addons.mozilla.org (AMO)]

2. Make sure `media.videocontrols.picture-in-picture.enable-when-switching-tabs.enabled` is set to `true` in `about:config`

=== Build from source

```
gh repo clone gavink97/pipn .
cd pipn
npm install
make eb
make build
```

=== Using pipn

Once pipn is installed, on any browsing tab that has audio playing pipn will
attempt to enable picture in picture mode by creating a new tab when focus
leaves firefox. This is because Firefox does not support the https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1463402[Picture in
picture API].

Upon focus having returned to firefox, firefox will then close the newly created tab and return you
to the original tab.
